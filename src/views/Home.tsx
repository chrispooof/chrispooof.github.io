          Hello! My name is Christian Bjerre-Fernandes. I am a recent graduate from the{' '}
          <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" className="no-underline text-cyan-600">University of Chicago</a>{' '}
          who studied computer science. In addition to computer science, I love to study languages and learn about
          other cultures. I took Japanese and Norwegian during college and continue to study Japanese even now.
          <br /><br />
          During college, I was a part of{' '}
          <a href="https://equalopportunityprograms.uchicago.edu/title-ix/rsvp-programming-center/" className="no-underline text-cyan-600">
            Resources for Sexual Violence Prevention (RSVP)
          </a>
          ,{' '}
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UChicagoTheMark/" className="no-underline text-cyan-600">The Mark</a>
          , and{' '}
          <a href="https://uncommonhacks.com/" className="no-underline text-cyan-600">Uncommon Hacks</a>.
          I also loved to participate in intramural sports with my house (Ultimate Frisbee, Foosball,
          Inner Tube Waterpolo, etc) and explore and eat food around Chicago as well as its suburbs.
          <br /><br />
          Now I am a software engineer at Capital One in their Technology Development Program in my second year
          of the program. I rotated from a team mainly doing devops work for a machine learning space to a team
          doing fullstack machine learning work on an internal application. Outside of work, I love to play Apex
          Legends (I main Horizon), watch movies (The Prestige, Lincoln Lawyer, etc. to name a few) and shows of
          all kind (Bojack Horseman, Love is Blind, etc.), photography, reading all sorts of things (manga, comics,
          fiction, etc.), and pickleball/biking.
